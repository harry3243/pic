In popular culture
The Ford Mustang has been featured in numerous media. Effective product placement allowed the car to reach "celebrity status in the 1960s".[129] In particular, "movie glamour" assisted in establishing a positive association with the Mustang.[130] The following are a few notable cases where embedded marketing influenced the sales or other tangible aspect of the vehicle:

The 1964 movie The Troops of St. Tropez, was the Ford Mustang's first appearance in a movie. "Contrary to popular belief, the Ford Mustang did not make its cinematic debut in the classic James Bond film Goldfinger. On September 9, 1964, Nicole Cruchot cruised around in a Poppy Red 1964.5 Mustang convertible in the French comedy Le Gendarme de Saint-Tropez. Known to American audiences as The Troops of St. Tropez, Cruchot's character, Geneviève Grad, holds the distinct honor of being the first person to drive a Ford Mustang on the silver screen."[131]
The 1964 movie Goldfinger, was the Ford Mustang's second appearance in a feature film and timed with the car's introduction in the US marketplace.[132]
The song "Mustang Sally", first recorded by Wilson Pickett in 1966 and covered by many other artists since, is about a man who buys a Mustang for his girlfriend, Sally, who ends up preferring the car over him. It has been described by one cultural historian as "free advertising for the Ford Motor Company."[133]
The TV series The F.B.I. was sponsored by Ford Motor Company. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. drove new Mustang convertibles during the first four seasons (1965–1969), and viewers can see how the Mustang evolved into a muscle car.[134]
Using real cars, Steve McQueen drove a debadged Highland Green 1968 Mustang GT fastback with a 390 cubic inch engine and 4 speed transmission in a chase scene, alongside a black 1968 Dodge Charger, in the 1968 film Bullitt.[135][136] Ford has released several special editions of the Mustang paying homage to the movie car.
A 1971 Mustang (modified to look like a 1973 model), nicknamed "Eleanor", was the feature car in the 1974 car heist film Gone in 60 Seconds. "Eleanor" returned, as a 1967 Mustang Shelby GT500, in the movie's remake in 2000. The remake version of Eleanor featured a custom body kit designed by Chip Foose that has inspired numerous restomods since.
The racing video game Ford Mustang: The Legend Lives, released in 2005, features only Mustangs.[137]
The 2008 TV movie Knight Rider featured a black 2008 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500KR as KITT (replacing the 1982 Pontiac Firebird from the original series), voiced by Val Kilmer.
The David Gelb directed documentary A Faster Horse covers the creation of the 2015 Mustang.[138]
The 2014 film Need for Speed features, along with a Shelby Mustang integral to the plot, a 2015 Mustang that briefly appears at the end. Like with Goldfinger, the scene was shot before the car was revealed to the public. A prototype was used and kept secret, with only the actors and film crew allowed to see the car.[139]
