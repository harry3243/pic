    <p>Gajar ka halwa is a combination of nuts, milk, sugar, khoya and ghee with grated carrots.[10][11] It is a light nutritious dessert with less fat (a minimum of 10.03% and an average of 12.19%) than many other typical sweets from the Indian subcontinent.[12] Gajar halwa has a medium shelf life so it is now sometimes exported.

        At festival time many people prefer vegetarian dishes as well as desserts in their thali. Because of its low fat content, vegetarian characteristics, ease of making, medium shelf-life and taste, gajar ka halwa is a popular dessert all over India and often served at most festivals. The dish is popular among adults as well as children. In 300 grams of gajar halwa there are 268 calories (76 come from fat, 180 from carbohydrate and 16 from protein).[13]</p>
